# Based 🔵
**Reputation on Base. Verifiable & Forever.**

> *Built for the Base Indonesia Hackathon 2025.* 🇮🇩

---

## � The Problem: Current Certs are L
Let's be real. Traditional certifications are kinda broken:
- 📄 **PDFs?** Easily photoshopped.
- 💼 **LinkedIn Flexes?** Often cap (fake).
- 👻 **Contributions?** Lost in the void.

Builders do the work, but have no **permanent, owned proof** of their impact.

## ✨ The Solution: Based
**Based** gives you onchain receipts for your work. No cap, just facts.

We issue **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** aka **Proofs of Contribution** on Base Sepolia.
- **You own it**: It lives in your wallet, not a centralized server.
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can check the smart contract.
- **Forever**: Immutable proof that you were there and you did that.

**It's not just a certificate. It's your onchain legacy.**

## 🚀 Features (Alpha)
- **⚡ Mint Speed**: Instant issuance by authorized orgs.
- **🆔 Basename Native**: We speak `.base.eth` fluently. No more boring `0x` addresses everywhere.
- **🔒 Soulbound**: Non-transferable. You earned it, you keep it. You can't buy reputation here.
- **📱 Social Ready**: One-click flex to Farcaster & X.

## ⛓️ The Tech (Under the Hood)
We built this using the freshest stack on the market:

| Component | Tech | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network** | **Base Sepolia** | Fast, Cheap, & Based. |
| **Framework** | **Next.js 15** | Peak performance & DX. |
| **Identity** | **OnchainKit + Wagmi** | Seamless Basename resolution. |
| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS** | Clean UI, no clutter. |

**Smart Contract:** [`0x639c...904`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x639c4DeB80473729437072449910633347520904)
